# Flexbook - Digital Imaging 1: Digital Photography Basics

Whether you just got a digital camera (or smart phone), are new to photography, or have a little experience, this course is for you. Each chapter will provide you with information, examples, opportunities to develop your skills, and time to reflect on what you've learned. Instead of a traditional end-of-course final, you'll be guided in the development of a digital photo portfolio to demonstrate your skills.
